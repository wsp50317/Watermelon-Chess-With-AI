# Project Title

Watermelon Chess is suitable for every age with the easy rules,but you still need to use your brain to win the chess game.  
This is my special topic for Artificial Intelligence courses,and I'm responsible for GUI.
(WIKI 's Introduction about Watermelon Chess : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon_Chess) 

## Getting Started

Open Eclipse and import the project,then run Main.java. 

1. You should choose that the AI is black chess(initative),or the AI is white one.

2. After the game start,you may move all chess in your turn whatever the color the chesses are (but still recommond that move your own chess)
Click a chess and click a place which you want again.
Try to beat the AI,and the status about the game will be shown on the top of the window.
